# Graph OOP implementation

This project implements a modular and extensible Graph class hierarchy in C++, supporting various types of graphs and common graph algorithms.

## Features

- Base `Graph` class for undirected unweighted graphs
- `DirectedGraph` class for directed graphs
- `WeightedGraph` class for undirected weighted graphs
- `WeightedDirectedGraph` class for directed weighted graphs
- Graph traversal algorithms: **BFS** and **DFS**
- Cycle detection in both directed and undirected graphs
- Count of connected components
- Shortest path using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**
- Topological sort using **Kahn's Algorithm**
- Minimum Spanning Tree using **Prim’s algorithm**
